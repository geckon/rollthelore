# RollTheLore
An *unseen servant* providing an *advantage* to DMs/GMs while creating their worlds.

As a DM, have you ever needed to lower the *DC* for the world building skill
check? Did you need to create the right NPC for your players to interact with
and thought you could use a *divine intervention*? Were you out of ideas and
felt like an *inspiration die* or a bit of *luck* was all that you needed? This
tool will probably not fulfill all your *wish*es but it can at least provide
*guidance*.

RollTheLore is a tool from a DM to other DMs out there but it can also help
players as it's supposed to inspire you while not only creating your world,
a shop or a random NPC encounter but it can also be used to help with your
backstories.

As of now it can only randomly create NPCs but I have some ideas for generating
towns as well and who knows? Maybe there will be even more. RollTheLore is not
meant to be a perfect tool but rather a simple one that still can provide very
valuable ideas for your campaigns and stories. At least for me personaly it
works very well as I often need a few simple points I can use as inspiration
and build more fluff around it with both imagination and improvisation.

Sometimes the generated character doesn't make much sense but often that is
exactly the fun part. When I need an NPC for a story I like to *roll* a few of
them and pick one as a basis, then I build on that. It can also be used to
pre-roll a few NPCs in advance and then use them e.g. when your players decide
to enter a shop or address a person you hadn't planned beforehand.

Primarily RollTheLore is intended to be used with DnD 5e but it can very well
serve for other game systems as well. The imagination is what matters the most.

Please note that the tool is under development. Ideas, comments and bug reports are
welcome!
